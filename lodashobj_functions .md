| _.functions        |Retrieves all function names of an object's own enumerable properties
     |

| _.get           |Gets the value at path of object
     |

| _.invert    | Creates an object composed of the inverted keys and values of object.             |
| _.invertBy    | This method is like _.invert except that the inverted object is generated from the results of running each element of object thru iteratee. The corresponding inverted value of each inverted key is an array of keys responsible for generating the inverted value.      |
| _.invoke    | invokes the method at path of object.            |
| _.keys    | Creates an array of the own enumerable property names of object.
            |
| _.keysIn    | Creates an array of the own and inherited enumerable property names of object |
| _.mapKeys    |Creates an object with the same values as object and keys generated by running each own enumerable string keyed property of object thru iteratee.'             |
| _.mapValues    |Creates an object with the same keys as object and values generated by running each own enumerable string keyed property of object thru iteratee.            |
| _.merge    |Recursively merges own and inherited enumerable string keyed properties of source objects into the destination object.          |
| _.mergeWith    |This method is like _.merge except that it accepts customizer which is invoked to produce the merged values of the destination and source properties. |
 | _.omit    |Creates an object composed of the own and inherited enumerable string keyed properties of object that are not omitted.           |
| _.omitBy    |Creates an object composed of the own and inherited enumerable string keyed properties of object that predicate doesn't return truthy for.        |
 | _.pick    |creates an object composed of the picked object properties.
           |
 | _.result    |invokes the method at path of object. Any additional arguments are provided to the invoked method.          |
 | _.set    |Sets the value at path of object. If a portion of path doesn't exist, it's created.            |
 | _.setWith    |This method is like _.set except that it accepts customizer which is invoked to produce the value to set.        |
| _.toPairs    |Creates an array of own enumerable string keyed-value pairs for object.
            |
 | _.toPairsIn    |Creates an array of own and inherited enumerable string keyed-value pairs for object |              
 | _.transform    |Iterates over own and inherited enumerable string keyed properties of an object, executing the callback for each property. The callback is bound to thisArg and invoked with three arguments: (value, key, object).  |             
                | _.unset    |Removes the property at path of object.

   |
               | _.update    |This method is like _.set except that accepts updater to produce the value to set. |
               | _.updateWith    |This method is like _.update except that it accepts customizer which is invoked to produce the value to set       |
               | _.values    |Creates an array of the own enumerable string keyed property values of object     |
               | _.valuesIn    |Creates an array of the own and inherited enumerable string keyed property values of object.
